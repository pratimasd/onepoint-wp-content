# Theme assets

Place images and icons used by the theme here.

**Header logo (site logo in header, when no custom logo is set in Customizer):**
- Add your logo as **`onepoint-logo.png`** or **`onepoint-logo.svg`**
- Recommended: teal ONEPOINT wordmark; height ~48px or SVG for sharp scaling
- If this file is present and no logo is set under Appearance → Customize → Site Identity, it is used in the header

**Header icon (three icons on the right):**
- Add your icon as **`header-icon.png`** or **`header-icon.svg`**
- Recommended size: 24×24 px (or SVG for sharp scaling)
- If this file is present, it replaces the default flask icon in the header
