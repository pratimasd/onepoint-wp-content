# Initiative Card block

Build from plugin root (builds all blocks):

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins/onepoint-custom-blocks
npm install
npm run build
```

Add multiple Initiative Card blocks and use the **Columns** block to place them in a row (e.g. 1 wide + 4 narrow) to match the Onepoint initiatives layout.
